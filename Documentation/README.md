# Getting Started

See this link to view this documentation as a website. 

## System Requirements

The project uses poetry for Python to create an isolated environment and manage package dependencies. To prepare your system, ensure you have an official distribution of Python version 3.7+ and install poetry using one of the following commands (as instructed by the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#system-requirements)):

### Poetry installation (Bash)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

### Poetry installation (PowerShell)

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -

```

Once Poetry is installed, it does not need activating. It can be used in the different ways, see [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/).

### Virtualenv installation and activation

The project also utilises a virtualenv for Python to create isolated environments.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

You would then need to create a virtual env. for the project:

```bash
pip -m venv name-of-venv
```

Activate the venv (Mac OS):

```bash
source name-of-venv/bin/activate
```

Activate the venv (Windows OS):

```bash
source name-of-venv/Scripts/activate
```

## Dependencies

The project uses a virtual environment to isolate package dependencies. To create the virtual environment and install required packages, run the following from your preferred shell:

```bash
poetry install
```

To add a dependency:

```bash
poetry add <NAME_OF_DEPENDENCY>
```

## Running the App

Once the all dependencies have been installed and relevant information has been inputted, start the Flask app in development mode within the poetry environment by running:

```bash
poetry run flask run
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with fsevents reloader
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 226-556-590
```

Now visit [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) in your web browser to view the app.
